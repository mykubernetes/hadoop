./flink <ACTION> [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]
 
The following actions are available:
 
Action "run" compiles and runs a program.
 
  Syntax: run [OPTIONS] <jar-file> <arguments>
  "run" action options:
     -c,--class <classname>               Class with the program entry point
                                          ("main()" method). Only needed if the
                                          JAR file does not specify the class in
                                          its manifest.
     -C,--classpath <url>                 Adds a URL to each user code
                                          classloader  on all nodes in the
                                          cluster. The paths must specify a
                                          protocol (e.g. file://) and be
                                          accessible on all nodes (e.g. by means
                                          of a NFS share). You can use this
                                          option multiple times for specifying
                                          more than one URL. The protocol must
                                          be supported by the {@link
                                          java.net.URLClassLoader}.
     -d,--detached                        If present, runs the job in detached
                                          mode
     -n,--allowNonRestoredState           Allow to skip savepoint state that
                                          cannot be restored. You need to allow
                                          this if you removed an operator from
                                          your program that was part of the
                                          program when the savepoint was
                                          triggered.
     -p,--parallelism <parallelism>       The parallelism with which to run the
                                          program. Optional flag to override the
                                          default value specified in the
                                          configuration.
     -py,--python <pythonFile>            Python script with the program entry
                                          point. The dependent resources can be
                                          configured with the `--pyFiles`
                                          option.
     -pyarch,--pyArchives <arg>           Add python archive files for job. The
                                          archive files will be extracted to the
                                          working directory of python UDF
                                          worker. Currently only zip-format is
                                          supported. For each archive file, a
                                          target directory be specified. If the
                                          target directory name is specified,
                                          the archive file will be extracted to
                                          a name can directory with the
                                          specified name. Otherwise, the archive
                                          file will be extracted to a directory
                                          with the same name of the archive
                                          file. The files uploaded via this
                                          option are accessible via relative
                                          path. '#' could be used as the
                                          separator of the archive file path and
                                          the target directory name. Comma (',')
                                          could be used as the separator to
                                          specify multiple archive files. This
                                          option can be used to upload the
                                          virtual environment, the data files
                                          used in Python UDF (e.g.: --pyArchives
                                          file:///tmp/py37.zip,file:///tmp/data.
                                          zip#data --pyExecutable
                                          py37.zip/py37/bin/python). The data
                                          files could be accessed in Python UDF,
                                          e.g.: f = open('data/data.txt', 'r').
     -pyexec,--pyExecutable <arg>         Specify the path of the python
                                          interpreter used to execute the python
                                          UDF worker (e.g.: --pyExecutable
                                          /usr/local/bin/python3). The python
                                          UDF worker depends on Python 3.5+,
                                          Apache Beam (version == 2.23.0), Pip
                                          (version >= 7.1.0) and SetupTools
                                          (version >= 37.0.0). Please ensure
                                          that the specified environment meets
                                          the above requirements.
     -pyfs,--pyFiles <pythonFiles>        Attach custom python files for job.
                                          These files will be added to the
                                          PYTHONPATH of both the local client
                                          and the remote python UDF worker. The
                                          standard python resource file suffixes
                                          such as .py/.egg/.zip or directory are
                                          all supported. Comma (',') could be
                                          used as the separator to specify
                                          multiple files (e.g.: --pyFiles
                                          file:///tmp/myresource.zip,hdfs:///$na
                                          menode_address/myresource2.zip).
     -pym,--pyModule <pythonModule>       Python module with the program entry
                                          point. This option must be used in
                                          conjunction with `--pyFiles`.
     -pyreq,--pyRequirements <arg>        Specify a requirements.txt file which
                                          defines the third-party dependencies.
                                          These dependencies will be installed
                                          and added to the PYTHONPATH of the
                                          python UDF worker. A directory which
                                          contains the installation packages of
                                          these dependencies could be specified
                                          optionally. Use '#' as the separator
                                          if the optional parameter exists
                                          (e.g.: --pyRequirements
                                          file:///tmp/requirements.txt#file:///t
                                          mp/cached_dir).
     -s,--fromSavepoint <savepointPath>   Path to a savepoint to restore the job
                                          from (for example
                                          hdfs:///flink/savepoint-1537).
     -sae,--shutdownOnAttachedExit        If the job is submitted in attached
                                          mode, perform a best-effort cluster
                                          shutdown when the CLI is terminated
                                          abruptly, e.g., in response to a user
                                          interrupt, such as typing Ctrl + C.
